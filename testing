Set System Time and Date Command

This function enables an application to set the system-wide date and time. Changes made using this

function are broadcast to all controllers and all terminals within the store system.

Format

ADXCS80L i

Where:

i = RCP STATUS file reset indicator, BACKGRND, or blank.

Y = Reset the RCP STATUS file and write output there.

N = Do not reset RCP STATUS file but write output there.

BACKGRND

Running in background (no output).

"blank"

Running in foreground (Command Mode) with output to the console.

command

One or more of the following separated by spaces:

+1 Increment the current time by one hour.

-1 Decrease the current time by one hour.

-B Broadcast current time without altering.

-Q No output (quiet mode).

-T HHMMSS

Change the current time to HHMMSS.

-D YYMMDD

Change the date to YYMMDD.

Note: This comment will run only on the master controller if on a multiple controller network. Some

commands are mutually exclusive (+1, -1, -B, -T) and only the last command is recognized. You

must set the time if you set the date (that is, -D requires the -T). The order of the commands is not

important. All of the commands implicitly broadcast their changes; you do not need to manually

broadcast the time after making a change. You should use +1/-1 wherever possible to avoid

inherent delays with setting the time directly. The system date and time can also be set using the

system functions menu option. See the IBM 4690 OS: User's Guide for details on using this method.

Hi Nabeel,

PFA the sheet with my comments.

 

Refer 4690 user guide for the commands available in controller. You can refer from chapter 5 onwards.

Hi Syam

 

  Subsequent to going through the Design and SUTP docs , I have a preliminary set of questions with regard to testing the updated the CrossDisk Backup application using DOS batch programs.

 

   Please let me know if we can discuss the attached questionnaire at a good time today afternoon?

 

Regards
